# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

For this project, I will build a profile for scenic places in the US. It will include a profile picture, name, and description. It will also include icons to allow a user to change their profile information and add places to the gallery. I will also build cards for each location that will include a like button. I'll use display flex and display grid to get the layout just right. This will also be functional as you move from desktop resolutions to screen resolutions. I will also be adding hover states to the cards and different buttons. I'm building the design based on the figma design I was given.

**Images**

I used tinypgn to compress the images and reduce the file size.
